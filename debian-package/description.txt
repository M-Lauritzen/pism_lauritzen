PISM is an open-source modeling framework for ice sheets and glaciers jointly
developed at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks and the Potsdam Institute for
Climate Impact Research.

PISM uses distributed memory parallelism based on MPI and PETSc to support high
resolution ice sheet simulations. Its features include a hierarchy of stress
balance approximations, marine ice sheet physics with dynamic calving fronts, a
polythermal, enthalpy-based conservation of energy scheme and extensible
coupling to atmospheric and ocean models. It is modular, extensible, and
includes comprehensive user documentation.
