This directory contains scripts showing how to model and visualize isochrones.

To enable isochrone tracking, set `isochrones.deposition_times`. This parameter uses the
same format as `output.extra.times` (a comma-separated list or a MATLAB-style range of
times).

The implementation is very similar to the scheme described in
