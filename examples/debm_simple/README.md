- A script that generates time-dependent orbital parameters that can be used for
  paleo-simulations with dEBM-simple. It uses trigonometric expansions from

  A. L. Berger, "Long-Term Variations of Daily Insolation and Quaternary Climatic
  Changes," Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, vol. 35, no. 12, pp. 2362â€“2367, Dec.
  1978.

  The implementation itself is heavily based on the code from GISS ModelE version 2.1.2
  (see https://simplex.giss.nasa.gov/snapshots/modelE2.1.2.tgz ).

  Note: ModelE documentation states "our code is freely available for download and use",
  but unfortunately it does not include a license.

  Run `orbital_parameters.py --help` for details.

  Note: PISM requires time bounds for all time-dependent inputs; see PISM's manual or the
  `Makefile` for a way to use `ncap2` from NCO to add them.

- A script `run.sh` and a `Makefile` that uses a SeaRISE-Greenland setup to run
  dEBM-simple

  - in the "present day" configuration
  - in a "paleo" configuration with time-dependent orbital parameters
  - in a "present day" configuration with provided time-dependent surface albedo

  and save a number of diagnostics to NetCDF files.

  Please see `run.sh` for command-line options needed by these simulations.
